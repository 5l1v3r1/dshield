### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ###

Honeypots are nothing new, and we didn't invent them. In particular, I would like to 
acknowledge the work of Michel Oosterhof who is maintaining cowrie, a tool we use to
collect ssh and telnet logs.

This probject would not be possible without the support from the SANS development team.

And of course, our feerless testers who have provided feedback allowing me to fix many of the
bugs I introduced:

* Matthew Glennon
* Parth Maniar
