If you are seeing this while running the open proxy text, your server is an open proxy.

You can test to see if your naked IP is serving an unauthenticated proxy with the following:

http_proxy=http://X.X.X.X:8080/ curl -4 -s http://nyc2.mirrors.digitalocean.com/tools/open_proxy_check.txt

where X.X.X.X is your server's IP4 address.
